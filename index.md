I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton and am planning to graduate in Spring 2025.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7
This was my favorite lab because we used a lot of if-else statements to figure out if we can park on a certain street at certain times. I liked learning about these if-else statements because if-else statements are used a lot in game development which is something I am interested in. It took me a while to figure it out but once I did, the rest of the lab went smoothly.

Lab 6
This was my second favorite lab because I enjoyed making blackjack, a card game, from scratch using coding. I liked learning about bool statements and using that to call functions to determine whether a not a card is what you want it to be. It was hard to figure out how to call functions but once I understood how to do it, I was happy that it clicked in my head.

Lab 9
This is my 3rd favorite lab because we used an algorithm to figure out the averages of many judgesâ€™ scores. I think that finding a real world application with a math equation was cool because it showed that what we are learning can easily be applied to real problems. This lab taught me to just go step by step and think logically to come up with an algorithm that is 100% reliable.
